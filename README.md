# pymadeeasy
## Introduction
Everyone has their own journey when learning a new language. pymadeeasy is intended to demonstrate my own journey through Python 3.x and identify ways to abstract problems into reusable pieces that can be used by any project.

***Constructive*** feedback is welcome at any time to help me along my Python journey.

## Current Version
0.0.1 includes the scope of this project and overall format via the README.md

## Next Version
0.0.2 will include common ways to make HTTP requests and receive responses

- [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) is a Python style guide from Google that points to a few common tools as well as formatting standards. As I learn more about these, I will strive to adhere to these so others can better understand my code.
